# dprint

This library is currently under construction, but will serve as the formatter for all my TypeScript projects. Not recommended for use yet.

[Implemented Nodes](implemented-nodes.md)

## Goals

1. Reasonable [configuration](schema/dprint.schema.json).
2. Work well above an 80 character line width.
3. Satisfy my formatting needs.
4. TypeScript and probably JSON support.
