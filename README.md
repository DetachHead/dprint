# dprint

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dprint.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/dprint)

This library is under construction, but will eventually serve as the formatter for all my TypeScript projects.

This is not recommended for use yet.

* [Implemented nodes](implemented-nodes.md) (140/155 -- only JSX nodes left)
* [Configuration schema](schema/dprint.schema.json) (more to come...)
* [API declarations](lib/dprint.d.ts)

## Goals

1. Reasonable configuration.
2. Satisfy my formatting needs.
3. TypeScript and jsonc support.
