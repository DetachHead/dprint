# dprint

This library is under construction, but will eventually serve as the formatter for all my TypeScript projects.

This is not recommended for use yet.

* [Implemented nodes](implemented-nodes.md) (118/155)
* [Configuration schema](schema/dprint.schema.json) (more to come...)
* [API declarations](lib/dprint.d.ts)

## Goals

1. Reasonable configuration.
2. Work well above an 80 character line width.
3. Satisfy my formatting needs.
4. TypeScript and probably JSON support.

## Licence

No licence for the time being. That means you are not legally allowed to use this, make any changes/derivitives, or provide contributions.
