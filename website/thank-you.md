# Thank you

Thank you for purchasing a license. Your action will help drive this project forward and lead to a better product.

## How to apply license?

Dprint doesn't use license keys in order to reduce friction. The only action you have to do to apply your license is update the project type property in your commercial project's configuration file (ex. *dprint.config.json*) to be `commercialPaid`.

```json
{
    "projectType": "commercialPaid",
    // etc...
}
```

Thank you for moving this project forward!
